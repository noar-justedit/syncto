// What happens when the run is over: nothing, quit, sleep, or shut down.
//
// Three actions, not four. There is no "hibernate" here because macOS has no
// such command — `hibernatemode` describes what the Mac does *during* sleep,
// it is not something you can ask for — and on Windows `shutdown /h` only
// works when hibernation is enabled, which it is not by default on machines
// with fast startup. An entry that silently does something else, or nothing,
// on half the machines is worse than no entry. FreeFileSync draws the same
// line: Exit / Sleep / Shut down.
//
// Everything here goes through the OS's normal, unprivileged path. Nothing
// asks for an administrator password, and nothing forces applications to
// close: another app with unsaved work can still stop a shutdown, which is
// the correct outcome.

// can be tested on every platform without putting a machine to sleep.

    // hibernation is enabled on the machine, and there is no way to force
    // plain sleep from a command line. Either way the machine goes to sleep
    // and wakes up where it was, which is what the setting promises.
