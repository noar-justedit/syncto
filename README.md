# syncto
### Folder comparison and synchronization — by Just Edit

Open-source folder sync for video and audio professionals. Same feature set as
FreeFileSync, rebuilt from scratch with the ingesto interface: progress ring,
live throughput graph, ETA, a checksum-verified copy that reads every file back,
and an exportable copy report.

<sub>Taken from the running application, not mocked up: `scripts/shots-linux.sh`
drives the real window through the DevTools protocol over a real dataset and
writes these files. They are regenerated at every release, which is how the
interface in them stays the interface you get.</sub>

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Compare** | by modification time and size, byte for byte, or by size only |
| **Synchronize** | 2 Ways, Mirror, Update, or a Custom rule per category |
| **Multi-pair** | one job synchronizes any number of folder pairs, FreeFileSync-style |
| **Moved files** | a rename is detected and replayed as a rename — no re-copy |
| **Verified copy** | one mode: every file read back and compared (xxHash64), with an optional checksum sidecar |
| **Deletion** | trash or permanent — always announced, never silent |
| **Filter** | per-job include/exclude patterns, name- or path-anchored |
| **Report** | HTML, CSV and JSON, with every checksum |
| **Locking** | one machine at a time per folder, safe over any network share |
| **Remote** | local disks, mounted network shares, and SFTP |

## Quick install (no coding knowledge required)

### Step 1 — Install Node.js
Go to **https://nodejs.org**, click the green **LTS** button, run the installer.

### Step 2 — Download syncto
`git clone https://github.com/noar-justedit/syncto.git`
(or **Code → Download ZIP** and unzip it wherever you like).

### Step 3 — Build the app
1. Open the `syncto/scripts/` folder
2. **Double-click `build-mac.command`**
   - If macOS asks for confirmation, click **"Open"**
   - A Terminal window opens and builds everything automatically
   - The first run takes 2–3 minutes (downloading dependencies)
3. When it's done, the script offers to open the `dist/` folder

For Windows, **double-click `scripts/build-win-from-mac.command`** — it
cross-builds from your Mac.

Double-click only ever works on a `.command` file: macOS opens a `.sh` in a text
editor. And if a launcher ever answers **"you do not have appropriate access
privileges"**, the folder travelled somewhere that drops file permissions (a
FAT/exFAT stick, a sync from Windows, some unzip tools). Open Terminal in the
`syncto` folder and run `chmod +x build.sh scripts/*.sh scripts/*.command`
once — the launchers repair themselves after that.

**Building the Windows version from a Mac works.** syncto's own code compiles
nothing — hash-wasm is WebAssembly and ssh2 is JavaScript. ssh2 does declare two
*optional* native modules, which npm installs on any Mac carrying the Xcode
command line tools; `electron-builder.yml` skips the rebuild pass and leaves
them out of the package, because nothing here needs them. The portable `.zip`
needs nothing extra; the `.exe` installer is assembled by Wine, so install it
once with `brew install --cask wine-stable` if you want it.

### Signing and notarization (macOS)

**There is nothing to run first.** The macOS build does all of it — double-click
`scripts/build-mac.command`, or run `./build.sh`, and that is the whole
procedure, now and for every build after.

With a **Developer ID Application** certificate in your keychain it signs the
app, sends it to Apple, and attaches the returned ticket to both the app and the
disk image. It then opens with a plain double-click on any Mac, with no internet
connection needed on first launch.

The **first** signed build asks two questions: your Apple ID, and an
**app-specific password** — made at appleid.apple.com → *Sign-In and Security* →
*App-Specific Passwords*, which is not the same thing as your Apple ID password.
Both go into the macOS keychain through `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`,
under the name `syncto-notarization`. They are never written into the project:
no file to add to `.gitignore`, no secret that can travel inside a release
archive. You are never asked again.

Every later build prints two green lines and gets on with it.

Nothing about this can cost you a build:

- **No certificate** → an unsigned build, exactly as before. If the only
  certificate you have is an *Apple Development* one — which signs the app
  perfectly and is then refused by every other Mac — it says so by name rather
  than reporting a vague failure.
- **Apple's command line tools missing** → signed, not notarized, with the one
  command that fixes it.
- **Apple unreachable, or the submission rejected** → the build runs again
  without notarization rather than leaving you with an empty `dist/`.
- `SYNCTO_SKIP_SIGN=1 ./build.sh` forces an unsigned build on purpose, and
  `./build.sh --sign-check` reports what you would get without building
  anything.

At the end it runs `spctl` and says what a *stranger's* Mac will do with the
file — a build that is signed but not notarized looks perfect on the machine
that made it and is refused everywhere else.

Nothing about this is mandatory. No certificate → the build produces an unsigned
app exactly as before, and `SYNCTO_SKIP_SIGN=1 ./build.sh` forces that on
purpose. The script says which of the three you got, and runs `spctl` at the end
to report what a *stranger's* Mac will do with the file — a build that is signed
but not notarized looks perfect locally and is refused everywhere else.

The Windows build is unsigned: SmartScreen warns on first launch
(**More info → Run anyway**).

From a terminal, `./build.sh` at the project root does the same:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `./build.sh` | macOS Apple Silicon `.dmg`, signed and notarized when it can be |
| `./build.sh --universal` | macOS Universal (Intel + Apple Silicon) |
| `./build.sh --win` | Windows x64 — portable `.zip` + NSIS `.exe` |
| `./build.sh --all` | macOS arm64 and Windows x64 |
| `./build.sh --dev` | run without building |
| `./build.sh --test` | run the engine test suite |

### Test without building (dev mode)
Install Node.js (Step 1), then double-click `scripts/dev.command`.

## Using it

### The window

- **Top**: the two folders. Type a path, click **Browse**, or drag a folder from
  the Finder onto the field. The line underneath shows the free space.
- **Toolbar**: how to compare and what to synchronize.
- **Grid**: one row per item, left side on the left, right side on the right,
  the decided action in the middle.
- **Bottom strip**: how many items will be created, updated or removed.

### Typical run

1. Set the two folders
2. Choose **Mirror →** (or another variant, see below)
3. Press **COMPARE** — nothing is written yet
4. Read the grid. Click any **action cell** to change that row's direction, or
   untick a row to leave it alone
5. Press **SYNCHRONIZE**, confirm the summary

### Synchronization variants

| Variant | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Mirror →** | the right side becomes an exact copy of the left. Anything extra on the right is removed. |
| **Update →** | new and changed files are copied rightward. Nothing is ever removed. |
| **2 Ways** | both sides converge. Needs the database from the previous run to tell a deletion from a creation — the first run therefore only copies. |
| **Custom** | you decide, per category, in the settings. |

### Moved files

When you rename or move a file (or a whole folder of rushes), syncto recognizes
it by its file id and simply renames it on the other side too — a 100 GB
reorganization synchronizes in seconds, nothing is re-copied and nothing passes
through the trash. Requirements: one previous run of the pair (the ids come
from the sync database), local disks or mounted shares (SFTP exposes no file
ids). When in doubt — the file changed as well as moved, ids are ambiguous
because of hard links — syncto falls back to a plain copy, which is always
safe. Switchable off in the settings.

### How a copy is verified

**syncto has one copy mode.** There is no faster setting that skips the check,
because the reason to run a folder synchroniser over rushes is to know the
second copy is the same as the first.

Every run works in two passes, like ingesto: everything is copied first, then
everything is read back from its final location and compared to the xxHash64
fingerprint taken while writing. The window shows the two passes as steps
before either starts, turns blue and reads `VERIFYING · xxHash64` during the
second, and the progress accounts for it — a run moves twice the data, and says
so.

**What that costs you:** roughly twice the time of a copy alone, and over SFTP
twice the network traffic, since the read-back crosses the wire too. That is the
price of the summary line at the end saying every file was read back and matched.

Because verification happens after the copy, a file that fails it has already
replaced the previous version. syncto reports the error, keeps the file out of
the checksum list, and does not record it in the database, so the next run
re-examines it. The size check still happens before the rename, so a truncated
copy never takes a good file's name.

Switch on **Write a checksum list** in the settings to get
`syncto-checksums.txt` at the root of each target: the shield button in the
title bar re-checks a folder against it months later, without the original
source.

xxHash is not cryptographic — it detects accidental corruption, not tampering.
That is the right trade-off here: it runs at several GB/s where MD5 crawls.

### Deletion

Removing a file is the only irreversible thing syncto does, so it never does it
silently:

- **Trash** (default) — recoverable. Local volumes only.
- **Permanent** — gone.

Network shares and SFTP have no trash: syncto stops and tells you rather than
deleting quietly — switch to permanent deletion (or flip the dedicated switch
in the settings) for those.

### Several machines, same folders

While a run lasts, syncto puts a `.syncto.lock` file at the root of each
synchronized folder and refreshes it every 5 seconds. Another machine starting on
the same folders **waits**, and tells you which machine and user is holding it.
A lock left behind by a crash is taken over after 12 seconds of silence — or
immediately, if the dead process belonged to your own machine.

The mechanism is FreeFileSync's, and it uses no operating-system locking: it
relies only on appending a byte and renaming atomically, which every network
share supports. Taking over an abandoned lock goes through a rename rather than
a delete, so two machines waiting on the same folder can never both start.

Switchable off in the settings — do that only if your storage refuses the extra
file.

### Filters

Per job (the funnel button), one pattern per line or separated by `|`.
One rule to remember:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `*.tmp` · `thumbs.db` · `Proxies/` | no `/` → matches the item's *name*, at any depth |
| `/Rushes/A001/` · `/notes.txt` | starts with `/` → one exact path from the pair's root |
| `…/` | folders only · `…:` files only |

Right-clicking any row (grid or overview) offers ready-made patterns; Space
excludes the selection temporarily.

### Servers (SFTP)

Click the **server button** next to *Browse* in either folder field. Enter the
address, the port, the login, and a password or a private key; syncto connects,
then lets you walk the server's folders and pick one — or create it. The field
ends up holding `sftp://user@host/path`, which you can still type by hand if
you prefer.

Servers you use again are listed at the top of that window: one click fills
everything in.

**Passwords are never written to a readable file.** They go to the macOS
Keychain or the Windows credential manager, through Electron's `safeStorage`.
If a machine has no usable credential store, syncto says so and asks for the
password each time rather than storing it in the clear. Only the *path* of a
private key is stored, never the key.

Everything else works the same, including checksum verification — it just reads
the data back over the network, so a run over SFTP is considerably slower than
on a local drive. SFTP has no trash and no inode information, so use permanent
deletion there, and expect renamed files to be re-copied rather than detected
as moves.

### When it finishes

**Settings › After the synchronization** offers *Do nothing*, *Quit syncto*,
*Sleep* and *Shut down*. The choice is saved with the job.

It only fires on a clean run — an error, a cancellation or a lost folder lock
leaves the machine on, so you can read what happened. And a 30-second countdown
with a **Cancel** button always comes first.

There is no hibernate entry on purpose: macOS has no such command, and on
Windows it only works when hibernation is enabled, which it usually is not.

**Settings › Phone notifications** sends a message through
[ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) when a run ends — the job name, what was copied, how
long it took, and the first error if there was one. Set a server (the public
one or your own), a topic, and scan the QR code to install the app. A problem
raises the priority so the phone actually rings.

On the public server the topic *is* the password: anyone who knows it can read
your notifications, so make it long. An access token, for a server that needs
one, is stored in the system credential store like every other secret here.

### When something fails

**Ignore errors** (Settings) decides what happens after the first failure. Off
— the default — the run stops there, writes its database and its report, and
tells you why. On, it works through every remaining item and lists the failures
at the end. Off is the right choice for a backup you are watching; on is the
right choice for an overnight job over a flaky network.

**Retries** are separate and always apply: a failing item is attempted the
configured number of times before it counts as a failure at all.

A folder that cannot be *read*, or a base folder that is not there, is never
treated as an empty folder — that would make a mirror delete the healthy side.
Such a run is refused, with the path that needs fixing.

### Jobs

**⌘S** saves the folder pairs and every setting as a `.syncto` file — the file
name IS the job name. **⌘O** opens one; recent jobs live in the left panel.
A job can hold any number of folder pairs (ADD PAIR), all sharing the same
settings, compared and synchronized in one go.

## Files syncto writes

| File | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `.syncto.db` | root of both folders | the last synchronized state, for two-way sync and move detection. Hidden, gzipped. Delete it and two-way sync restarts from scratch. |
| `.syncto.lock` | root of each folder, while running | who is synchronizing right now. Removed at the end; reclaimed automatically after a crash. |
| `syncto-checksums.txt` | root of each target | the checksum list, when **Write a checksum list** is on (merged run after run) |
| `*.syncto_tmp` | next to a file being written | fail-safe copy. A leftover means a run was interrupted; the comparison ignores it and the next synchronization removes it, reporting how much space it reclaimed. |
| `*.syncto_old` | next to a file being replaced, on SFTP | the previous version, parked for the instant it takes to rename its replacement into place. SFTP cannot replace a file atomically, and deleting the target first would lose it if the connection dropped. Swept like any leftover. |
| `syncto_<job>_<date>.html` | `Documents/syncto reports` | the report. Written outside the synchronized folders on purpose. |
| `install-id` | `~/.syncto/` | identifies this installation to the directory lock, so two machines sharing a hostname cannot mistake each other's lock for their own. Delete it and a new one is generated. |

## Files syncto never touches

Neither side of a comparison ever shows these, and they are never copied:
`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`, `.Spotlight-V100`, `.fseventsd`,
`.TemporaryItems`, `.DocumentRevisions-V100`, `System Volume Information`,
`$RECYCLE.BIN`, `.Trashes`, and syncto's own `.syncto.*` files.

When a folder holding one of them has to be **removed**, the operating system's
own bookkeeping folders go with it — `System Volume Information` and friends are
recreated by the volume on the spot if it still wants them. **`.Trashes` and
`$RECYCLE.BIN` are not**: they hold files somebody deleted and may want back, so
a folder containing one is left alone and the reason is reported.

Anything else still in the folder — a file your exclusion filter hides, a
symbolic link — stops the removal, on purpose, and syncto names it.

---

## Testing the engine

```bash
npm test
```

Creates real folders in a temporary directory and runs the whole engine against
them: filters, comparison categories, the four variants, the two-way database,
checksum verification, versioning, fail-safe copy and the folder rules.

It also reads the build scripts and checks every option they pass to Apple's
`notarytool` and `stapler` against the documented ones. That is a strange thing
for an engine test suite to do, and it earns its place: an invented flag makes
notarytool reject the command line before it ever reaches Apple, which looks
exactly like a wrong password, and no amount of mocking `xcrun` will catch it.

---

## Regenerating the screenshots

```bash
bash scripts/shots-linux.sh          # Linux, or a container: needs Xvfb,
                                     # dbus and gnome-keyring
```

It builds a demo dataset under `/Volumes`, seeds a profile, launches the real
application and drives it through the DevTools protocol, writing
`docs/screenshots/*.png`. Nothing is mocked up: the verification frame is a real
verification pass, and the "another machine is running" frame is a second
process genuinely holding the lock, under its own user, install id and machine
name.

Worth knowing before running it:

- **The keyring must be unlocked inside the session bus**, otherwise
  `safeStorage` reports itself unavailable and the connection window gets
  photographed saying "this machine has no usable credential store" — true of a
  build container, false of every Mac. The script handles it; a manual run of
  `scripts/shots.js` does not.
- **These pictures are a test.** Regenerating them for 0.5.4 is what surfaced
  the unstyled fields in the connection window and two labels left over from the
  three-copy-mode era. A frame forces you to read a whole screen at once;
  a code review reads one function at a time.

---

## Updates

At startup syncto quietly checks `version.json` on this repository (same
mechanism as ingesto). If a newer release exists, a small dismissible notice
offers to open the releases page. Nothing is downloaded automatically, the
check never blocks startup, and dismissing a version silences it for good.

---

## Converting FreeFileSync jobs

```bash
node scripts/ffs-convert.js MyJob.ffs_gui [more…] -o converted/
```

One `.syncto` per FreeFileSync configuration, all folder pairs included.
Variants, filters and retry settings are translated; FFS versioning falls back
to the trash.

---

## What is not there yet

- Real-time folder watching (the RealTimeSync equivalent)
- Batch jobs from the command line
- FTP (SFTP only)

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome — read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) first. The
short version: `npm test` must stay green, engine changes need a test, and
contributions are GPL-3.0-or-later like the rest.

Security issues: see [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Credits

The behaviour is modelled on [FreeFileSync](https://freefilesync.org) by Zenju,
also GPLv3 — the comparison categories, the four variants and the versioning
schemes follow it closely so that habits transfer. No FreeFileSync code is used;
syncto is written from scratch in JavaScript on Electron.
